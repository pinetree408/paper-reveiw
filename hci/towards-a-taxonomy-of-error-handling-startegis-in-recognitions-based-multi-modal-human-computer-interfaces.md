## Towards a taxonomy of error-handling strategis in recognition-based multi-modal human-computer interfaces
### RECOGNITION-BASED TECHNOLOGY
The main aim of this work is to establish a classification of error-handling strategies that can serve as a tool for understanding how to develop more efficient and natural multi-modal human-machine interfaces

### ERROR-HANDILING STRATEGIES IN RECOGNITION-BASED INTERFACES
Mankoff et al. suggest four key research areas for error-handling in recognition-based interfaces: error reduction, error discovery, error correction techniques and toolkit-level support.

#### Error reduction by design
"Error reduction by design" describes techniques that achieve error reduction by leading users towards the production of inputs that are easier to recognise by machines.
"Error reduction by design" techniques exercise various levels of control and infulence on user action and behaviour.

#### Error reduction by context
"Error reduction by context" achieves error reduction by augmenting user inputs with contextual information.
"Error reduction by context" techniques encompass two classes of systems
- feature level multi-modal systems
- context-aware systems

#### User prevention
"User prevention" strategies decribe strategies spontaneously adopted by users to prevent recognition errors.

#### Automatic detection
techniques for the automatic detection of errors can be further classified into statistical, ruel-based and multi-modal methods.

#### Machine discovery
All of the strategies listed in this section are for the purpose of helping users to become aware of recognition errors and to facilitate their corrections.

#### User correction
Strategies for error correction include
- repeat
- spell out
- reshape
- contradict
- modality switch
- cross-modal correction

### TAXONOMY
#### Classification based on actor and purpose
##### Error prevention by machine or by users
- Most strategies for error prevention can be attributed to the machine. They work in two possible ways:
  - The interface is designed to influence of constrain  user behaviour into less error prone interaction
  - greater recognition accuracy is achieved through the use of additional or contextual information
- The category "error prevention by users" comprises three strategies that rely on users spontaneously adapting their behaviour towards less error-prone interaction.
  - modality selection
  - complementary inputs
  - redundant inputs

##### Error discovery and error correction by machine
- Error discovery by machine works in three posible ways:
  - by using statistical data
  - by applying knowledge-based rules
  - by exploting cross-modal information

##### Error discovery and error correction by users
When a recognition error occurs, users are normally in charge of notifying the machine.
Once errors have been found, users can effectively help the machine resolve them, usually by producing additional inputs.
The question on how to best support the development of these automatisms remains an important challenge in research on error correction.

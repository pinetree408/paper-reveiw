## A comparative Study of Moded and Modeless Text Editing By Experienced Editor Users

### Introduction
- Modes refer to the editor's interpretation of the user's input; there is a mode change each time the interpretation of the same input changes.
- An editor is modeless if its interpretation of the same user input is always the same.

In thie context, moded editing means that the editor user must enter a special command before text is inserted and another special command to end the text insertion and return to the command mode. Modeless editing is different; ordinary characters are entered directly as text. There are no special commands required to enter or stop entering text.

Clearly, the tradeoffs between moded and modeless editing depend on both the users and the terminal type.

### RESULT AND DISCUSSION
#### Mode Errors
We found that people using the moded editor vi did make moded errors. However, we also found that subjects using the modeless editor emacs made response that fit the definition of the first type of moded error.

### SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that moded editing, as exemplifed in the vi editor, may be preferable for fixed editing tasks, while modeless editing, as exemplified by the emacs editor, may have some advantages for free composing.

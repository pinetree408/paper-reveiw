## "How in the world did i ever get into that mode?" Mode Error and Awarenesss in Supervisory Control

### INTRODUCTION
We think that the classic concept of mode error is inadequate to describe the problems in human interface with today's automated resources.
In this paper, we extend the concept of mode error to take into account the problems caused by new automation capabilities - mode awareness.

### Mode Awareness
Multiple odes in devices can create the potential for mode errors.
Human supervisory control of automated resources in event-driven task domain is a quite different type of task environment as compared to the applications in the original research on mode error.
This capability of highly automated systems drives the demand for mode awareness, that is, the ability of a supervisor to track and to anticipate the behavior of automated systems.
What is involved in maintaining mode awareness is determined to a large extent by the design and capabilites of the automated resources and especially the interface between the automations automation and the people in the system.
Therefore, how have changes in automations and in the interface between person and automated resources impacted mode awareness?

### The Complexity of Modes in Automated System and the Challenge to Mode Awareness
Consequently, mode annunciations could be dedicated to one spatial location on the display.
The operator seemed to be able to detect and recover from erroneous actions relatively quickly.
The result is numerous mode indications distributed over multiple displays each containing just that portion of the mode status data corresponding to a particular system or subsystem.
The resulting system behavior can be disastrous but may be missed by the operator if adequate feedback is not provided to support mode awareness.
Display modes are another factor aggravating the problem of mode awareness.
Another complicating factor that makes it difficult to maintain awareness of the active mode configuration is the fact that many systems allow for simultaneous use by multiple practitioners rather than input by just one individual user.

### Some Empirical Results on Mode Awareness in Pilot-Automation Interaction
Most of the observed difficulties were related to lack of mode awareness and to gaps in mental models on how the various automated modes work and interact.
Another interesting result of this study was related to the futrue-oriented aspect of mode awareness.
The complexity of modes challenges the human supervisor's avility to track and anitcipate the behavior of the automation - mode awareness.
Difficulties in maintaining mode awareness focus on transitions between more quiescent phases or situations where mode behavior is complex of transitions frequent.

#### Sources of Problems in Mode Awareness
The data on problems in mode awareness imply that there are two kinds of contributing factors.
- One is buggy mental models.
    - The former derives from a failure of the designers of automation to anticipate the new kinds of knowledge demands their automation creates and a failure to provide mechanisms to help practitioners acquire and maintain this knowledge in ways usable in actual operational contexts. 
- The other is opaque indications of the status and behavior of the automation.
    - The latter derives from a failure of designers to support the supervisor's increasingly challenging cognitive demand of tracking the state and behavior of the automation as another kind of dynamic process within their scope of responsibility.

The data on problems in mode awareness strongly imply that this cognitive demand is poorly supported by the kinds of displays on the state of the automation currently provided to practitioners.

#### Copint with Mode Error and Aiding Mode Awareness
- First, one can say that mode awareness problems are induced by the complexity of the technological system.
- Then one avenue to improve the human-machine system is to reduce the operational complexity induced by how technology is developed.
In the case of mode awareness this can be stated quire clearly - reduce the number and complexity of the modes.
- A third direction for change is to develop new forms of aiding mode awareness itself through changes in the interface and displays that reveal what the automation is doing, why it is doing that, and what it will do next. The strategy is to provide better indications of what mode the system is in, how future conditions may produce changes without direct practitioner intervention, and support better detection of and recovery from mode misasseements and mode errors when they do occur.
- However, developing such aids probably requires that we advance our understanding of how attention shifts across the perceptual field in dynamic multi-task domains. In this kind of field of activity, shifting the focus of attention does nnot refer to initial adoption of a focus from some neutral waiting state. Instead, one re-orients attentional focus to a newly relevant event from a previous state where attention was focused on other data channels or on other cognitive activities.
- Anotehr desigin aiding path that has been proposed to deal with mode related problems is forcing functions. Forcing functions are defined as "something that prevents the behavior from continuning until the problem has been corrected."

### Implications for the Concpet and the Study of Situfation Awareness
#### Measuring Situation or Mode Awareness
Measurement techique cannot be developed or used in a theoritical vacuum. There are three major categories of measurements,
- a) subjective ratings
- b) explict performance meausers
- c) implicit performance meaures

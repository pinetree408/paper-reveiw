## A New Statistical Approach to Chiness Pinyin Input

### INTRODUCTION
In this paper, all the technology is based on sentence-baed input method, but it can easily adapted to word-input method.
In our approach we use statistical language model to achieve very high accuracy. We design a unified approach to Chinese statistical language modelling.
Another problem is that in order to type both English and Chinese, the user has to switch between two modes. This is cumbersome for the user. In this paper, a new typing model is proposed to solve these problem.

### Modeless Input
Another annoying UI problem of Pinyin input is the language mode switch.
The mode switch is needed while typing English words in a Chinese document.
It is easy for users to forget to do this switch.

### Conclusion
- We obtained conversion accurary of 95%, which is 50% better than commercial systems.
- to make the system usable in the real word, we proposed the spelling model, which allows the user to enter Chinese and English without language mode switch, and typing model, which makes the system resident to typing errors.
- Compared to the baseline of system, our system gets approximate 30% error reduction.
